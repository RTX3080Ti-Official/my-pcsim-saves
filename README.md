# My PCSim Saves
My PC Simulator saves.

> [!TIP]
> Some of these saves using a [save editor](https://discord.gg/CZgJnHgv4s), do **not** share them on the official PC Simulator Discord server as you will get banned for *Rule 14*.\
<sup>Except if you want to get banned</sup>

> [!TIP]
> It looks like Yiming changed the encryption format in 1.8.1 (iOS and iPad version), so if you can, downgrade to 1.8.0 or use an Android.
